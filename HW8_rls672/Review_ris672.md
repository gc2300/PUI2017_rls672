**Plot**

**CLARITY**: __is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?__

The plot is clear, and can see each borough with 3 years data. It is easy to know the trees become more in each year.

This plot includes clear caption, describe and legend.

**ESTHETIC**: __beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?__

I can see clearly by the color, it plot the same color with same year.

I think it would be better to choose green color, and it can let the graph build strong connection between numbers and trees.


**HONESTY**: __is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?__

This plot is straightforward. I can clear see the difference for each year in each borough.


**IMPROVEMENTS TO PLOT**

Color connection:
If change the color to green, I think it would be better.
